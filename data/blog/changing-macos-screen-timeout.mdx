Did you try checking the 'Desktop & Screen Saver' settings in the System Preferences? If not there then where could the display timout setting be found?

Well the 'Turn Display Off After' slider setting can actually be found and changed in the 'Battery' section of System Preferences.

Once I get comments on this please tell me if you think Apple is in left field on this placement, thanks.
