# Stable Diffusion

## What it it

Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image model that generates images from a text 'prompt' you provide. Recently another text-to-image model called DALL-E from OpenAI garnered widespread awe and attention for its ability to generate impressive custom images.

Stable Diffusion differs in that it is open source, while DALL-E is available for a cost through an API. Stable Diffusion is also a different ML architecture than DALL-E since DALL-E was trained using GPT-3 (transformers), while Stable Diffusion is a diffusion model, the same as Google's recent text-to-image model Imagen.

**Diffusion Models** try to 'de-noise' gaussian noise, step by step. After a labelled image has been distored through gaussian noise it will look like a pixelated fuzzy picture, Diffusion models reverse the noise and after each step the picture will lose noise and be more realistic.

Stable Diffusion incorporates three components for implementing 'latent diffusion' which is a faster and more efficient form of diffusion. Latent diffusion utilizes three components, an autoencoder (VAE), a U-Net, and a text encoder CLIP. Using these components Stable Diffusion receives a text-prompt and then outputs an image of that prompt.

## How to Run

To run the Stable Diffusion 'inference pipeline' and try it's text-to-image capabilities you should have a computer with at least 8GB of ram and GPU capabilities. I personally needed to use Google's Collab to run the model and my computer ran out of memory. Hugging face provides a collab notebook that lets you run it through a browser on Googles computer.

## The Code

The following code is available on the previously linked collab notebook and it basically comes down to the following:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", revision="fp16", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_auth_token=True)

pipe = pipe.to("cuda") # pipe to 'mps' on a Mac
from torch import autocast

prompt = "calgary flames winning the stanley cup in the dome with moustaches all around"
with autocast("cuda"):
  image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
```

Change the prompt to whatever you want, but know that their is a NSFW checker in the library (look for the function check_safety()). My prompt created this:
