The 'Owner' of this domain. I generally use SQL and Python at work, then tinker with Cloud Services and the Javascript ecosystem at home.

This site was built with React.js (Nextjs). I'll be working on this is blog side project to try and add commenting and more. My Posts are written in markdown or "mdx", and pushed to a GitHub repo, which triggers the site to be rebuilt. I am open to receiving pull requests for posts that are tech or data related.
