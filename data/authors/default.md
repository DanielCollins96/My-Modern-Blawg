Hey I'm the 'Owner' of this domain. I'll be working on this blog as a side project for networking and to improve my writing and programming. A bit about me, I generally use SQL and Python at work, and then tinker with Cloud Services and Javascript on the side.

My Posts are written in markdown or "mdx", and pushed to a GitHub repo, which triggers the site to be rebuilt. The code for this blog is available on my Github page, it is a Next.js (React) project.

I am open to receiving pull requests for posts that are tech or data related.
