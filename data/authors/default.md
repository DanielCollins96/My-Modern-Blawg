I'm the 'Owner' of this domain. I generally use SQL and Python at work, then tinker with Cloud Services and the Javascript ecosystem at home.

This site was built with React.js (Nextjs). I'll be working on this is blog to add content and features like commenting. My Posts are written in either markdown or [mdx]('https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/mdx) and pushed to this site's GitHub repo, that push triggers the site to be rebuilt.

I am open to receiving pull requests for posts that are tech or data related.
