The 'Owner' of this domain. I generally use SQL and Python at work, and tinker with Cloud Services and Javascript ecosystem at home.

I'll be working on this is blog side project to try and add commenting and more. My Posts are written in markdown or "mdx", and pushed to a GitHub repo, which triggers the site to be rebuilt. I am open to receiving pull requests for posts that are tech or data related.
